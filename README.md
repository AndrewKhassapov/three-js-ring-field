# Three.js ring field

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/andrew-khassapov/pen/eYGwvJN](https://codepen.io/andrew-khassapov/pen/eYGwvJN).

Using THREE.js to create an orbit of objects.

Object mesh shapes can be changed. All objects rotate around the centre (0,0,0).

Background is a CSS gradient. Skybox disabled.

Additional wireframe effect added to shapes.

This needs some proper documentation and refactoring.
